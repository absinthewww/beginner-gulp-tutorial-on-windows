# Start using gulp in minutes

**Note: If you don't use Windows, you can skip Step 1 and proceed from Step 2.**

*~ Introductionary ~*

*Are you a web developer that use Windows? Do you want your life to be easier and have more free time? No? Get out and continue being miserable. Is that yes? Good, please proceed, in 30 minutes to couple hours (depending how slow you are) you'll have automatic task all set up that will work for you while you work. It will help you to finish projects much faster and more effectively. [You can learn more about how gulp is useful](#why-gulp-is-useful) and take a look at some of their plugins that would help you in web development.*

## Terminal (Windows)
You need a terminal to use npm and gulp. Terminal is available out of the box on Linux and OS X. Windows has it as well but cmd and PowerShell is not sustainable for development work. You do not need to be experienced with terminal to function, but learning basics would help. Just few commands like `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, and stuff, you can learn it [over here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line), it will help you in long run so you won't get stuck in terminal for minutes to hours over a stupid `ls` command. If you don't like this site, this [alternative](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/less-command) might work.

We'll use cmder as a replacement terminal, however it's a separate software and does not directly replace default terminal.

> *Cmder is a software package created out of pure frustration over the absence of nice console emulators on Windows. It is based on amazing software, and spiced up with the Monokai color scheme and a custom prompt layout, looking sexy from the start.*

1. Download and install [cmder](http://cmder.net/). I use full version because I use git. Ensure to check a checkbox "Add to PATH" during the installation.

2. Open cmder. If you have runtime error when starting cmder, you'll probably need to install VS 2015, see [the issue here](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/501). If you got different errors, Google/GitHub will get you a fix right away, if not, report it on their repo issues section.

3. Go to cmder settings by right clicking an icon on top-right of window or press `Win+Alt+P`. Navigate to **Startup -> Tasks** on sidebar, select `{cmd::Cmder}` in Predefined tasks and enter `cmd /k "%ConEmuDir%\..\init.bat"  -new_console:d:%USERPROFILE%` as a command, then save. ![Startup -> Tasks](http://i.imgur.com/3bsKj8v.png)

4. Navigate to **Startup** on sidebar and select `{cmd::Cmder}` on *Specified named task* dropdown. [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/UAU4bwk.png "Startup settings").

5. You can change background to black like I did in **Colors** or tweak preferences to your liking.

### Deeper look
`cmd /k "%ConEmuDir%\..\init.bat"` is my favorite command application for cmder because it runs linux commands (a little limited though, it's Windows) like [`ls -la`](http://i.imgur.com/xR25Wcq.png), `cat`, `cd`, `touch`, `du`, `cp`, `rm`, and bunch of other commands, obviously with arguments as well. Feels like home right here. I suspect it's because I installed full version that included git, and of course, git includes linux commands.

Some people prefer using Powershell as a shell for cmder, which I don't understand, but if you want to, you can set it.

### Basics

Like mentioned before, you never used terminal, just learn terminal basics [here](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). If you don't like this site, this [alternative](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/less-command) could work out.

I assume that you've never used cmder before, learning few hotkeys will help you in long run. It may resemble other terminals. Image below is information for cmder that can be found on their site.

## npm

We need npm to install gulp, so we're going to do that.

1. Download and install [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). During the installation, be sure 'add to PATH' is included ([image](http://i.imgur.com/lHiNR7p.png)). 

2. When installed, restart cmder and enter `npm` in terminal to see if it's working properly, i.e it should look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ef2INPb.png). If it does, proceed to the next step.

## gulp
At last, we're on gulp section. This isn't going to be quick and short. Installation would be quick, but configuration to configure for your web development workspace... not really. Trust me, it will worth it in long run, I'll convince you.

1. Open a terminal (cmder) and install gulp globally with this terminal command: `npm install --global gulp`. It should look something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/nLfKlVv.png).

2. Congratulations! You've installed gulp!

Good job. Maybe it was easy, maybe it wasn't, but you made it. You installed gulp on terminal on *Windows*!

**You already have gulp installed, you're set. All what you have to do is set it up for your work environment since everyone else have it different! Go to Google and find a gulp tutorial for beginners to start learning how to configure gulpfile.js, install plugins and make it work for your workflow.**

**I also listed useful gulp plugins below that you can use it as a reference after being more familiarized with gulp configuration from tutorials you find.**

## Why gulp is useful?
Gulp is an automatic tool that help you out with several web development related tasks such as: 

* **[browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/)** — fires up a local web server `(localhost:3000 for own computer, 198.168.1.7:3001 for other devices, etc)` for all local devices and browsers to access. It auto refresh on any file save (configurable of what folder to watch), even when you replace an image with new one. You can view your website on your computer, tablet, mobile device and other devices while coding. You can use dev tool freely because Brackets' live preview would crash if you do that.
* **[gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass)** — compiles SCSS to CSS files before BrowserSync load, very configurable to your preference. You'll need [gulp-plumber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-plumber) to stop gulp from crashing if SASS threw any error or any other type of error.
* **[gulp-concat](https://github.com/contra/gulp-concat)** — it's usual to have several separated external dependencies files like jQuery, Modernizr, and more, plus you have to link them all in HTML/PHP files. With concat, it can compile all of these js files to one vendor.js file.
* **[gulp-uglify](https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify)** — remember how we compiled several js files to one vendor.js file? Let's minify it, too! Remember, it's all done automatically. Every time you edit one of js file, gulp-concat and gulp-uglify will repeat the procedure and make it ready.
* **[gulp-rename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rename)** — instead of having minified vendor.js, let's rename it to vendor.min.js. Automatically, of course.

There is many more useful plugins you can use to make your web development life easier. Here's a small list that can be useful for you.

###HTML
* **[gulp-htmlmin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-htmlmin)** — minifies HTML files
* **[htmlhint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-htmlhint)** — HTML linter/hinter

###CSS
* **[cssbeautify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cssbeautify)** — CSS beautifier
* **[gulp-uncss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uncss)** — cleans unused CSS files (run before CSS autoprefixer, optimizer, minifier and renamer if you have these)
* **[gulp-autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer)** — CSS autoprefixer
* **[gulp-csslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-csslint)** — CSS linter

####CSS optimizer, minifier and renamer
**[gulp-csso](https://github.com/ben-eb/gulp-csso)** — this is an advanced CSS optimizer that optimize from

```
a {
    font-family: Arial;
    font-style: italic;
    font-size: 14px;
    line-height: 18px;
    font-weight: bold;
    background-image: url('example.png');
    background-color: red;
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```
to

```
a {
  font: italic bold 14px/18px Arial;
  background: red url('example.png') no-repeat / cover;
}
```

I consider that very impressive. (Maybe you just learned little CSS here, hehe)

After the optimization, run **[gulp-clean-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-clean-css)** if you want to minify your CSS. Don't forget to use **[gulp-rename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rename)** to rename the file from \*.css to \*.min.css. 

It's all have to be configured in `gulpfile.js`.

###Images
* **[gulp-imagemin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin)** — compresses images to lower filesize without quality loss
* **[gulp-spritesmith](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-spritesmith)** — converts images to a spritesheet and outputs CSS variables

###Others
* **[gulp-watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-watch)** — it's a task that watch files, and when a file get modified or updated, it will run specified gulp tasks. It's essential gulp plugin and the tutorial you'll find will probably mention it.
* **[gulp-notify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-notify)** — sends system error notification when gulp task fails.

## Can I just test it?

Sure, I have a repo for you to see what happens if you run gulp.

1. Download this folder in my [repo](https://github.com/dmxt/bootstrap-scss-gulp-starter-kit/tree/master/bootstrap-scss-gulp).

This repo has standard bootstrap CSS and JS, minimal index.html, blank main.scss and configured gulpfile.js with following gulp plugins:
* **BrowserSync** — automatically refresh in browser when the watched file is saved.
* **SCSS compiler** — automatically compiles SCSS to CSS on save. It compiles `/scss/main.scss` to `/css/main.css` so HTML file can read it.
* **Plumber** — prevents gulp crash on SCSS error.

2. Navigate to this folder /gulp/ with your terminal with `cd` (Windows only: instead of navigating, you can add cmder to context menu [with a .reg file](https://gist.github.com/jojobyte/66c8346ed8948b9b395f). Of course, you need to edit paths to your path to cmder.exe file in a .reg file before running it.)

3. Install dependencies by running `npm install --save-dev` in terminal. It reads gulpfile.js and download & install necessary files for gulp to run. (You need to be in 'gulp' folder to do this)

4. Finally, run `gulp`. It will take several seconds to boot up a web server, boot up these scripts and then it will be up and running. You also need to be in gulp folder to do this.

5. Any changes you make will be auto-refreshed and applied to the site. You can write regular CSS in .scss file and SCSS compiler will compile it to other CSS file and BrowserSync fires again and browser reloads to display the change. If gulp crashed, just run `gulp` again.

If you use Bootstrap, you can use my repo as a base to start a new website. **Configure and embrace gulp!** 💪
